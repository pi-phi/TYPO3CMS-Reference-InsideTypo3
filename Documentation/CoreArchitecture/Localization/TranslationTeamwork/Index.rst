Translation teamwork?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Most likely you would like to translate TYPO3 with help from other
native speakers from the community. These are the options:

- **Set up your own translation server:**

  - Install TYPO3 and add those extensions you would like to support in
    you translation

  - Install “llxmltranslate” and use the backend module “llXML” for
    translation

  - Add user accounts for other translators (set their backend language to
    the language they are supposed to translate)

  - The result - the language pack in “typo3conf/l10n/[language key]/” is
    ready for distribution.

  - Pro: You have maximum freedom to keep the translation up-to-date with
    current core and extensions. You can distrubute the language pack as
    you like.

  - Con: You have to intiate the technical set up yourself.

- **Use official translation server:**

  - Get URL, username and password from translator newsgroup.

  - If the language is just added you will have to wait until Kasper
    announces that the translation server is updated with the new core.

  - Pro: Easy solution, don't have to install TYPO3 yourself.

  - Con: You must accept long times between core updates to that server
    and cannot distrubute your work yourself.
