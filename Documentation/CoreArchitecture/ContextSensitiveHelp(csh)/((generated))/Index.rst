Basic facts about Context Sensitive Help
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

These are some basic facts about how CSH works:

- Context Sensitive Help (CSH) labels are stored in locallang files
  inside of extensions, typically in a main file with English and sub-
  files with the individual languages.

- The CSH locallang files are typically named 'locallang\_csh\_\*.xml'

- They are translated as any other locallang file on typo3.org 
  by the backend module in the extension "llxmltranslate".

- CSH labels can override or add themselves to existing values thus
  allowing for local, customized help. Very flexible.
